    <p>
        Similarly to RFI, RFII works by applying a 1% fee to each transaction and instantly splitting that fee among all holders of the token.
    <br><br>
    Holders do not need to stake or wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by the smart contract and are immediately reflected in the holders balance.
